## Up and Running

    $ npm install

After installing the dependencies, you can run a server by running the following command:

    $ npm start

After that, you need to build the frontend project, so you just need to type:

    $ npm run webpack:build

Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000/` and play aroud!
